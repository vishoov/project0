//Different Layers of Security 

database leak 


//Password Encryption


name, email, password, age, gender 

just before saving 
bcrypt 
password -> encrypt 

ilovemangoes -> 4p89y4pohf[h[i04y/.nrlh[9ehofb;g49[y[98ghfpkb;fb]]]]]

just before saving the user information in the database 
update password 
change password 


password + secret key (salt string)    ===== Algorithm ======> Encrypted Password    
            this only we know

password decrypt -> trial error -> 16 years! to decrypt one normal string 

bcrypt 




//API authentication

remembering your devices 

session save 

youtube ----------> login 

api authentication 
JWT json web token 

//store the sessions

scalability 





RESTful 
STATELESS 




routes 
- Public -> which anyone cass access signup page, login page, home page 
- Protected -> wherever sensitive information is being sent or recieved 








// Password authentication 





Hackers trying some attacks on our product
//DoS Attack -> Denial of Service 

server working -> 10000 

one hacker comes-> bots -> fake requests -> 49630

server will be overwhelmed 




Rate Limiting 

your server restricts number of requests recieved by the server in a small window of time

//Server Protection 

amazon server -> amazon front end 

any request coming from any IP address except for the trusted one, it will be rejected 


CORS -> Cross ORigin Resource Sharing 





//Evironment Variables 

hide the secret keys, api keys, port numbers, development related data 


.env -> API_KEY, URI, secret key 


//input sanitisation



//XSS prevention
