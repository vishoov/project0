What is aggregation pipeline?
Aggregation pipelines are a powerful feature in MongoDB that allow you to process, transform, and analyze data directly within the database. They are modeled after data processing pipelines, where documents flow through a series of stages, each performing a specific operation on the data

An aggregation pipeline consists of an sequence of stages where each stage takes in documents as input, processes them and analyses them and passes the output to the next stage 


Stage               Use

match           match -> age:20 
group           groups documents by a specified key 
project         how do we want to display the data 
sort            ascending  or descending 
limit           10000000-> query -> 100 output so that my api is lightweight 
unwind          if we an array -> documents 
out             if we want to save the output of the aggregation pipeline to            a               different collection
skip            to skip a few starting documents
